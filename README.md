# ambidand

`ambidand` is a handy-dandy library of functions that demonstrates curried versions of python language features and tastes like candy.

despite the playful rhymes, `dand` is pronounced like "bland". i guess that's just my modus operandi.

## examples

```python
dand(x)(y)          # `x and y`
dor(x)(y)           # `x or y`
dxor(x)(y)          # `x xor y` (if python had xor)
dif(expr)(x,y)      # `x if expr else y`
```
